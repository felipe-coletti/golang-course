# Exercise 3

Using the previous exercise as a basis, use slicing to demonstrate the values:

-   From the first to the third item of the slice (including the third item!)
-   From the fifth to the last item of the slice (including the last item!)
-   From the second to the seventh item of the slice (including the seventh item!)
-   From the third to the penultimate item of the slice (including the penultimate item!)

Obtain the same result above using the `len()` function to determine the penultimate item
