# Exercise 5

In the following chapters, one of the things we will look at is testing.

To test your ability to do it yourself:

-   Try to figure out how testing works in Go on your own.
-   You can use an automatic translator, run code on your machine, search on your browser... Anything goes.
-   Create a simple test of a function or method or any piece of code.
