# Exercise 6

Using the solution from the previous exercise.

In the package-level scope, using the var keyword, create a variable with the identifier `y`. The type of this variable must be the underlying type of the type you created in the previous exercise.

In the main function:

-   This should already be done:
    -   Show the value of the variable `x`
    -   Show the type of the variable `x`
    -   Assign 42 to the variable `x` using the `=` operator
    -   Show the value of the variable `x`
-   Now also do:
    -   Use conversion to transform the type of the value of the variable `x` into its underlying type and, using the `=` operator, assign the value of `x` to `y`
    -   Show the value of `y`
    -   Show the type of `y`
