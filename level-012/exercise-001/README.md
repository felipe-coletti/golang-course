# Exercise 1

Create a `dog` package.

This package should export a function `Age`, which takes as a parameter a number of years and returns the equivalent age in dog years.

Document your code with comments, and use the `Age` function in your main function.

Run your program to verify that it works.

Run a local server with godoc and read its documentation.
