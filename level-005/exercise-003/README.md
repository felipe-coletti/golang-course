# Exercise 3

Create a new type: `vehicle`

The underlying type must be struct

It must contain the fields: `doors`, `color`

Create two new types: `pickup` and `sedan`

The underlying types must be struct

Both must contain `vehicle` as an embedded struct

The `pickup` type must contain a bool field called `fourByFour`

The sedan type must contain a bool field called `deluxe`

Using the structs `vehicle`, `pickup` and sedan:

Using composite literal, create a value of type `pickup` and give values ​​to its fields

Using composite literal, create a value of type `sedan` and give values ​​to its fields

Demonstrate these values.

Demonstrate a single field of each of the two.
